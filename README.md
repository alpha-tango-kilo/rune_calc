# elden_runes

Tells you how many of which rune items you ought to use to get to your desired amount.
Not very smart yet, but I'm working on it.

## Installation

```shell
cargo install --git https://codeberg.org/alpha-tango-kilo/elden_runes
```

(Add `--force` if updating)

## Usage

```shell
elden_runes want [number] have [number]
```

"want" and "have" can be either way around
